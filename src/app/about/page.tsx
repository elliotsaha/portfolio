                      Over the course of four years, I have dedicated myself to
                      the intricacies of developing React web applications, an
                      endeavor that has allowed me to navigate and leverage the
                      capabilities of various meta frameworks such as NextJS and
                      Gatsby. I have experience developing and publishing
                      component system libraries, building authentication
                      systems, and have leveraged CI/CD systems. Currently, I’m

              The first stage in building a web application to design and
              prototype it, allowing me to develop a general theme of the

              The second stage in building a web application, after the initial
              design and prototyping phase, is development. This phase is marked
              by transitioning from conceptual and visual models to functional
              software. It involves meticulously planned steps enabling the web
              application to scale.

              The integration phase is a critical phase in building web
              application development, as it focuses on ensuring that all
              services and APIs the application relies on are seamlessly managed
              across both development and production environments.

              The final phase in building a web application is management, which

              maintaining the application to ensure its optimal performance,
              security, and relevance to users. This stage is crucial for
              sustaining the application&apos;s utility and user satisfaction over
              time.

                Currently, I&apos;m a first year student at the University of British
                Columbia, and when I’m not building projects, I’m mostly hanging
                out with friends eating at sushi places in Vancouver or I’m
                drinking coffee at one of the many beaches this city has to
                offer. Before I came here though, I lived in Edmonton, AB where
                the majority of projects were made. I used to volunteer for the
                City of Edmonton Youth Council and worked on various initiatives
                regarding mental health awareness, sexual violence prevention,
                and committee wellbeing.
